1️Clone the repository

2️Open a terminal in the project folder

3️Works best with a GPU but also runs on CPU

4️Add your images inside SWE_DATA/, each in a folder named with the roll number (e.g., SWE_DATA/23BCS005/IMG1.PNG) ideally 5 different photos will work.

5️Run the project: python3 start.py — this opens the main UI for image augmentation and processing.
